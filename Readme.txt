Tired of reading long articles in LCD screen? I'm a programmer and I love to read, but I have already spent hours on computer screens.
Therefore, I write this little application to allow read-lovers to spend more screen time on Kindle. Try this out!

Leveraged technologies:
- Selenium
- Python

Requirements:

2. Run the second script and find all your links in the Links.txt

4. Use P2K service, to transfer your links from Pocket to Kindle
